# Remote Pairing

Back in 2017, I published my opinion of remote pairing at [linkedin](https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/remote-pairing-xin-zhang/?trackingId=zPP7jxc8QuWWI2e3yVN6Vw%3D%3D).
After 6 years, let me revisit this topic and share more insight.

Before pandemic in year 2020, remote is minority in work place.
People have to figure out mostly on their own how to work remotely effectively.
This involves setting up home office, time/geo boundaries around the house, and team dynamics to be inclusive to the remote peers.

Post pandemic in year 2023, working from home is a common practice.
However, return to office (RTO) gets more attention as people discovered a default way of working from home solo will hurt the productivity, namely:
- the distractions from home responsibilities, e.g. house chores, kids, etc.
- the social isolation of long time working from home, e.g. missing water-cooler talk, lack of face-to-face communications
- the technical challenges, e.g. unreliable ISP, poor audio/video equipment, noisy neighbors, lack of dedicated home office

Last time, I mentioned `remote buddy` to keep people accountable during remote working.
This time, I want to share some of my experiences of addressing the additional issues mentioned above.

## Distractions from Home Responsibilities

Since there is no geo fence to shield me from the home distractions, I established the time boundary around my house:
- Core: 9am-6pm CT for pairing and meetings
    - with fixed lunch break aligned with US west cost (12:30pm to 1:30pm) from 2:30pm to 3:30pm CT.
    - with fixed dinner break from 6pm to 7pm CT.
- Extended: 7pm-9pm CT for cross-geo meetings only
    - mostly with US west coast, China, and India peers.
- Light Friday:
    - since I may work ~10 hours from Monday to Thursday, I make Friday very light
    - mostly team planning meetings (pre-IPM), retro meetings, team bonding meetings, and backlog grooming meetings in the morning
        - this also aligned well with company wide breaks nicely for people to take a longer break
    - and very light afternoon

Here is the context, I lived in Central Time Zone and work with peers from US west coast, US east coast, Canada east coast, Europe, India, and China.
The above schedule help me clearly setup time boundaries between myself, my peers, and my family.

First of all, the family time boundary.
Everyday, after 9am, my family knows I will start working. After few conflicts, I start to establish this routine with the family.
They also expect I am free during the two meal times.

Also, we defined emergency handling protocol. If my door is closed, that means I am in a meeting cannot be interrupted.
If it's really an emergency, e.g. water pipe break, kitchen on-fire triggered fire alarm, etc., then my wife knock on the door, and left a post-it.
So that, I can properly communicate the emergency to the meeting and handle those.

Second, the team boundary.
Now, people clearly know when I will be online and responsive to the slack.
(I am still not responsive to the email, but only use fragmented time to check my emails.)

## Social Isolation

I am wondering if people tested on how long a person can work solo until they feel isolated.
My time is like 4 hours. If I don't talk to my peers for 4 hours, I start to feel the isolation.
If it last for the whole workday, like 8 hours, then my productivity started to drop.

I know my weakness, so I work the best to keep myself connected.
Most time I observed from other practices, the company communications are through emails and group meetings, and occasionally direct messages like teams and slack.
Those communication channels can exchange the business information, but doesn't build the social connection directly.

The emails are actually async communication channel. I can imaging person's intention or reaction when reading or writing emails, but I cannot actually see it.
The email system is a great channel to have high-bandwidth communication, e.g. large amount of information transfer, but doesn't need real-time feedback.
However, it's not a system designed for real-time communication, even though I do see people using email as a group chat platform.

Then, the group meetings. 
The group meetings are good for sharing context, usually in broadcasting fashion.
It's good to collect real-time feedback from the participates.
However, if there are more than 2 people in the group meeting, the full attention between people are missing.
Especially with remote meeting, and multiple monitors or screens competing for attentions, I am easily distracted to other screens.

The solution for the social isolation is intentional pairing.
The pairing can be done in 1:1 meetings, like meeting with reports, the meeting with peers (like I have regular meeting with my PM), the meeting with my mentors or mentees, or it can be [pair programming](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pair_programming).

Regardless of how I am meeting with, the important part is to create opportunities for 1:1 meetings.
1:1 meetings force people to pay full attention to the meeting.
To me, the `full attention` is the secret to handle the social isolation.
I even join the [`donut` program](https://vmware.slack.com/apps/A11MJ51SR-donut?tab=more_info) to increase my 1:1 meeting opportunities.

## Technical Challenge

This is really wide topic, and it's impossible to get a best setup for the home office.
Here are some principles to setup my home office and reduce the technical challenges:
- Stay away from wireless network. If possible do a hard link.
- Invest in a good HD webcam. [Logitech 4K Pro Webcam](https://www.logitech.com/en-us/products/webcams/4kprowebcam.960-001390.html) can be a good start.
- Make sure the webcam facing a wall
  - Try to avoid sitting in front of a window, since the backlight can make your face really dark.
  - Try to avoid have webcam facing the door, since everybody can see who is passing by behind you, like this famous [BBC interview](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mh4f9AYRCZY).
  - Put a green screen on the wall, so that you can switch it with your favorite background, and still can show and tell what's in your hands if you want to.
- Invest in good quality noise cancelling microphone
  - My favorite one is [Shokz OpenComm UC](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B09F572Q69)
  - It can last for a day of working
  - It doesn't block my ears, so my ears won't feel hot or waxy after a full day wearing it
  - It's bone conducting, so I can hear clearly without blocking my awareness of my environment

## Recap

I know working from home has many challenges.
I shared the 3 tips to handle these challenges:
- time boundary to protect from home distractions
- 1:1 pairing meetings to protect from social isolation
- good A/V and wall facing setup to maximize your presence

Even though post pandemic, a lot of companies are encouraging or enforcing RTO, I still believe working from home properly has the best potential of high productive individuals and teams.
I am looking forward to the [Apple Vision Pro](https://www.apple.com/apple-vision-pro/) to bring the telepresence to the next level.

Thank you so much for your time.
