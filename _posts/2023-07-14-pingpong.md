# Remote Working from Home

## TL;DR

Get your jump rope and start exercise during the break of [remote pairing](2023-07-07-remote-pairing.md) sessions.

## Context

When I was in [Pivotal Software](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pivotal_Software), the company is like other startups having ping-pong as the team building as well as pairing rest time activity.

For people working at home, then even I can do remote pairing, there is noway I can do a remote ping-pong that can:
- stay away from the screen
- exercise and increase the blood oxygen on brains
- build bonding during the exercise

The ping-pong time is usually short, and people can come back to pairing refreshed.

Then, what shall I do in this case?

## Proposal

What activity people can do at home during the break of the remote pairing session, that can:
- short and well exercised
- fun and increase the blood oxygen to the brains
- away from the screens
- weather proof
- almost most people can do
- ...

The lists can go on, but for one purpose is to have a quick exercise, relax the brain, and improve the pairing productivity.

This is the one: jump rope. 
My wife actually ordered [this one](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0B8YCPCNM?psc=1&ref=ppx_yo2ov_dt_b_product_details) from Amazon.

## Conclusion

One thing I don't recommend to do during the break:
- watching Netflex. Yeah, I tried, it's too short to see anything meaningful, or I have to ditch my peer.
- playing computer/console games. And after playing one game of Overwatch 2, my brain and eyes are more tired than before.
- taking a nap. Well, that rest my eyes, but need another 15 minutes or so to bring it back to speed, don't even mention I fall in sleep and missed the alarm.

Well I hope you have enough exercise ideas at home, so that you can take a good time away from the screen, exercise, and come back to work more happy and productive.
